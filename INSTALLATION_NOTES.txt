JSHELL INSTALLATION NOTES
=========================

The jshell installer does NOT automatically modify your PATH environment variable.

To use jshell from anywhere in your system:

OPTION 1: Add to PATH manually
------------------------------
1. Open System Properties > Environment Variables
2. Edit the "Path" variable (System or User)
3. Add: C:\jshell
4. Click OK and restart your command prompt

OPTION 2: Use full path
-----------------------
Run jshell using the full path: C:\jshell\jshell.exe

OPTION 3: Create batch file
---------------------------
Create a batch file in a directory that's already in PATH:
@echo off
C:\jshell\jshell.exe %*

UNINSTALLATION
--------------
If you manually added C:\jshell to your PATH, remember to remove it manually before uninstalling.

The uninstaller only removes:
- Files in C:\jshell
- Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts
- Registry entries for Add/Remove Programs

Your PATH variable will remain unchanged.
